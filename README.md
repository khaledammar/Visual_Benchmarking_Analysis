## Configuration

Once you install those libraries. Then, create a directory, this is where everything will be held. Place the summary_reader.py from github in this directory. The summary.txt should be in this directory. Note that this file is generated by the code in "process_log_files".

Then, create the directories named static and templates with in the directory that was first created. When you download the html files (get_summary.html, summary_histogram.html, error.html) from github put them into the templates directory. Find the files named d3.js, d4.css, and d4.js. Then move these files into the static directory.
